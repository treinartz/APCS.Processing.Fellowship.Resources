## Part 1 Introduction

To explore Advanced OOP requires understanding classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance, and concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  We begin here with interfaces and polymorphism.  To prepare, complete the following before the activity implementation.

* First, click here [Advanced OOP](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/JavaReview/index.html) to read about Interfaces and Inheritance that specifically addresses the AP Computer Science subset.
* Second, take a look at some Processing code for Interfaces here [Processing Interfaces](
https://processing.org/reference/implements.html) 
* Third, watch this video on polymorphism, a concept used for both Interfaces and Inheritance.

* Later, click here  [Processing Inheritance](
http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp22/example-22-01-inheritance) to see some sample code in Processing
* Then, watch this video on Inheritance

## Part 2: Activities, Code and Instruction

Activity #1:  Fundamental to these concepts is a thorough understanding of terms used when referring to object oriented programming.  Click here  [OOP Concepts](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3BpoNlyrw3QzdOsm-rxMtCWDjyJW4Q1BfKRHbelO-c/edit?usp=sharing) for a sheet to get you started. 

Activity #2:  Students write their own dog class that implements the Dog interface below.
