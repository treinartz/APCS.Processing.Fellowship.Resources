## Part 1 Introduction

To explore Advanced OOP requires understanding classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance, and concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  We begin here with interfaces and polymorphism.
     
* First click here [Advanced OOP](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/JavaReview/index.html) to read about Interfaces and Inheritance that specifically addresses the AP Computer Science subset
* Second, click here  [Processing Inheritance](
http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp22/example-22-01-inheritance) to see some sample code in Processing
* Third, watch this video on Inheritance
