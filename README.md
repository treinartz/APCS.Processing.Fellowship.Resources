# AP Computer Science in Processing

Here is our open source github book on Processing for APCSA Educators!  

AP Computer Science A is a course offered by the College Board that allows students the opportunity to earn college credit for a college-level Computer Science course by taking a standardized test in May. 

While there are many different approaches and tools for teaching AP Computer Science A (AP CSA), this book is intended to provide teachers with four different modules for four different units in AP CSA. The modules will include topics typically found on the APCS exams in May, and will generally consist of a teaching guide, practice AP questions, and a project prompt for students. 

Units/Chapters are listed below!
