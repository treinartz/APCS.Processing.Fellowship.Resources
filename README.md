# AP Computer Science in Processing

Here is our open source github book on Processing for APCSA Educators!  

AP Computer Science A is a course offered by the College Board that allows students the opportunity to earn college credit for a college-level Computer Science course by taking a standardized test in May. 

While there are many different approaches and tools for teaching AP Computer Science A (AP CSA), this book is intended to provide teachers with four different modules/units/chapters for AP CSA. The chapters will include topics typically found on the APCS exams in May, and will generally consist of a teaching guide, practice AP questions, and a project prompt for students. 

This is a work in progress, but initial chapters are listed below!

[Introduction and Conditional Logic](https://github.com/treinartz/APCS.Processing.Fellowship.Resources/blob/gh-pages/chapters/IntroAndConditionalLogic.md)

[Strings](https://github.com/treinartz/APCS.ProcessingResources/blob/gh-pages/chapters/Strings.md)

[Advanced Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/treinartz/pFellowship/blob/gh-pages/chapters/oop.md)

[2DArrays](https://github.com/treinartz/pFellowship/blob/gh-pages/chapters/2dArrays.md)




We have provided currated links to resources, but this is not meant to be a comprehensive curriculum. Our materials are meant to be teacher focused and include supplementary materials (videos and assessments) that could be integrated into a CS A course. These resources focus on activities that take advantage of the features of processing while reinforcing concepts that are important for the CS A exam.
